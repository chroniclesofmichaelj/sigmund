# Sigmund: A Freudian Therapy GPT

Sigmund is a GPT customized to practice Freudian psychoanalytic therapy, specializing in dream interpretation, free association exercises, and analysis of defense mechanisms.  
This repository contains the Custom Actions and OpenAPI specifications that enable Sigmund to connect to external tools and APIs for enhanced therapy sessions.

## üìö Project Overview

- **Custom Actions**: Extend Sigmund‚Äôs capabilities beyond conversation with external API integrations.
- **Dream Analysis**: Interpret dream symbols based on Freudian psychoanalysis.
- **Free Association**: Offer prompts that stimulate unconscious thought patterns.
